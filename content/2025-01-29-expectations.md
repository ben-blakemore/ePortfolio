# Expectations
Having previously completed an apprenticeship in Software Development in which Object Orientated Programming (OOP) was taught, I was initially unsure of how much I would learn from the module. Having now completed the module, I'm able to reflect on it as having still been a great learning experience. My prior understanding allowed me to push the boundaries of the assignments and apply some of the skills I have been using in my own professional capacity through work.

Coming into the module I was comfortable with the concept of OOP and how to apply it, so didn't expect to learn anything groundbreaking. And I think this held true throughout the module. What I feel that I gained from the module though is a deeper appreciation of how to apply these concepts into larger scale systems and the design choices that go along with this. As I worked through the material I found myself gaining an increased understanding of how small decisions, for example in class design, can scale into larger system behaviours.

I was hoping that the module would encourage me to think more deliberately about maintainability and flexibility rather than merely getting code to run. I have written more extensive thoughts on this in a post specifically about the humanoid robot assignments but I feel this is where the module really showed its strengths. It also introduced me to new patterns and strategies that I'm excited to experiment with in future modules and my work.
