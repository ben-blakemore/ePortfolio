# Skillset

Coming into this module, my exposure and knowledge in regards to network security were minimal. In my job as a software engineer I very rarely have to consider the security side of the software that I am writing, so I was excited to learn more about this.

The reading material in each week has really helped me build a solid foundation on which to take on the summative assignments. One of the first concepts I was introduced to was the Cyber Kill Chain (CKC), through the first lecturecast. This is just one of the many methodologies that potential attackers may follow in order to exploit security vulnerabilities. My initial notes on the CKC methodology are shown below.

I particularly liked the CKC framework, the reasons for which are described below in this excerpt from my baseline review and analysis assignment.

In summary, what gravitated me towards the CKC methodology was its use of chronology to effectively help timeline an attack, which I felt made it easier to anticipate how certain vulnerabilities might be exploited.


In order to utilise the aforementioned methologies, an attacker must learn
